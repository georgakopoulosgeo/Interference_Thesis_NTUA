=================================================================================================================
Scenario 1: Gradual Escalation – "Ramp Up"

A scenario that begins with very light interference and ramps up progressively.
- Minutes 0–10: Sparse deployment activity with mostly 1-replica pods, few overlapping cycles.
- Minutes 10–20: Increased frequency of deployments, alternating 1 and 2 replicas, mixed interference types.
- Minutes 20–30: High saturation with frequent, overlapping deployments across both nodes.

Goal:
- Test if the scheduler detects trends and scales preemptively, or reacts too late like the naive baseline.

=================================================================================================================

Scenario 2: Asymmetric Node Pressure – "Biased Battlefield"

One node is deliberately kept under more consistent and higher pressure than the other.
- Node 1: 65–70% of cycles, often 2-replica deployments, especially cpu/l3 types.
- Node 2: Lighter and less frequent deployments, some gaps and lower replica counts.

Goal:
- Evaluate if the scheduler can recognize node-level resource exhaustion and rebalance.

=================================================================================================================

Scenario 3: Flavor-Skewed Interference – "Flavor Split"

Interference is split by type (flavor) between the two nodes.
- Node 1: Predominantly membw (memory bandwidth) deployments.
- Node 2: Primarily cpu-bound deployments.
- Light l3 deployments on both sides as background noise.

Goal:
- Examine whether the scheduler distinguishes hardware-specific interference types and adapts accordingly.

=================================================================================================================

Scenario 4: High Frequency Bursts – "Pulse Storm"

Frequent, short-lived bursts of activity followed by brief cooldowns.
- Each burst: 3–5 overlapping deployments per node, lasting 60–90 seconds.
- Cooldown periods: 30–40 seconds with minimal or no interference.
- Pattern repeats 8–10 times over 30 minutes.

Goal:
- Stress test the scheduler’s responsiveness to rapid interference changes.

=================================================================================================================

Scenario 5: Sudden Node Failover Simulation – "Tilt the Scales"

A scenario where the second half forces one node to take over more load.
- First 15 min: Balanced interference across nodes.
- At minute 15: Node 2 experiences a dry period (only 1 pod max); Node 1 takes on heavy cycles.

Goal:
- Test scheduler’s ability to redistribute workloads under a sudden change in available capacity.

=================================================================================================================

Scenario 6: Interference Oscillation – "See-Saw Effect"

Interference alternates back and forth between nodes in a wave pattern.
- Node 1: High load for 5 minutes, then drops to low.
- Node 2: Low load initially, then takes over high load for next 5 minutes.
- Repeat the cycle 3 times.

Goal:
- Assess how well the scheduler adapts to shifting load dominance over time, and whether it avoids overshooting.
